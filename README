II. Design
----------

A. Graphics
OpenGL API along with GLUT and freeglut has been used to render graphics.

B. Concurrency
Pthreads have been used to make threads. The project follows a 1 thread per ball model. Barriers via mutex variables have been used for synchronization.

C. Physics
All collision have been considered to be perfectly elastic and vector equations for elastic collisions have been used to handle collisions.
Collisions are checked for those balls who are approaching each other at each frame.

D. Additional Features
i) Pause/Play.
ii) Speed Control of a Ball.
iii) Change Colour of a Ball.
iv) Add/Remove a Ball.
The additional features are discussed in detail in the subsequent How to Use Section

All design decisions have been discussed in detail in the Design Document. Any changes from the Design Document are mentioned in the Changes Document.

III. How to Use

To start the application, the following make targets can be used on the commandline (in the directory containing the Makefile)
i) make execute NUM_THREADS=n 	: n is the Number of Balls desired by the used. Default value for n is 5. n should be <=100. This launches the full screen wallpaper application.
ii)make DEBUG NUM_THREADS=n     : n is the Number of Balls desired by the used. Default value for n is 5. n should be <=100. This
					launches an application along with verbose output for various processes in the animation
iii)make doc			: this launches the complilation of the latex source files in the document

iv)make document    		: this launhces the compilation of latex source files created by doxygen


Once, the application is launched, n randomnly coloured balls moving with random velocities appear on a black background with a menu bar on the top of the screen.
The user has the following GUI Based Options :
i) Pause/Play : The user can press the spacebar key to pause/play the animation. The user can also pause/play from the menu that appears on a right click on the screen.
ii) Speed Control of a Ball	 : Once the animation is paused, the user has an option to change speed of a ball under the limits of a predefined minimum  and maximum. This can be done by clicking on the ball and using the Up/Down Arrow keys.
iii) Change Colour of a Ball 	: Once the animation is paused , the user can right click on a ball and select the change colour option from screen.
iv) Add/Remove a Ball 	     	: When the animation is paused , the user can left click at any point of the screen and then right clicking the screen gives an option to add a ball of a random radius if it is possible to do so. Right clicking on a ball gives the user the option to remove it from the screen.
